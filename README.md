## About
This game is a vertical platformer similar to a game on old Nokia cellphones (I forgot its name). The player controls a ball to 
move around elevating platforms. The goal is to avoid going over the ceiling or falling below the floor. However, this game is 
different from the original version because **it's 3D**. Each platform is in fact a rectagle viewed from above. The player can 
rotate the camera to view the platforms from different angles. This adds infinite possibilities (and cool visual effects) to the game.

This game is a final project for the Fall 2018 iteration of CIS 120.

## Control
Use **A** and **D** to move left and right.

Use **SPACE** to jump.

Use **control buttons** to reset, pause, and resume.

Use **LEFTARROW** and **RIGHTARROW** to rotate the camera by 90 degrees.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. Run ```make run```
