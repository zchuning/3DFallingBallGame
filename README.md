## About
This game is similar to a game on old Nokia cellphones (I forgot its name). The player controls a ball to move around 
a collection of elevating floors. The goal is to avoid going over the ceiling or falling through the floor. However, this 
game is different from its classic verision because it's 3D. The player can rotate the camera to see the floors from 
different angles. This adds infinite possibilities (and cool visual effects to the game).


## How to play?
Use **A** and **D** to move left and right.

Use **SPACE** to jump.

Use **control buttons** to reset, pause, and resume.

And don't forget to try **LEFTARROW** and **RIGHTARROW**. They're beyond your imagination...
