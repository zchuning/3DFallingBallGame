## About
This game is similar to a game on old Nokia cellphones (I forgot its name). The player controls a ball to move around 
a collection of elevating floors. The goal is to avoid going over the ceiling or falling below the floor. However, this 
game is different from the original version because **it's 3D**. The player can rotate the camera to view the floors from 
different angles. This adds infinite possibilities (and cool visual effects) to the game.


## How to play?
Use **A** and **D** to move left and right.

Use **SPACE** to jump.

Use **control buttons** to reset, pause, and resume.

Use **LEFTARROW** and **RIGHTARROW** to rotate the camera by 90 degrees.
